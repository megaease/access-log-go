# access-log-go

`access-log-go` is a Go library designed to collect access logs from web applications built with the Gin and Echo frameworks. It provides middleware that seamlessly integrates with your application to gather access logs and send them asynchronously to a backend system via Kafka. This helps in centralizing logs for analysis, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
